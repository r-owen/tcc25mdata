! History:
! 5/13/99 R.O. First version with history. Changed secondary collimation
!              coefficients based on data taken with Larry Carey.
!              We suspect the change is based on damage to the flex pivots
!              or some other physical change to the system.
! 5/17/99 R.O. Secondary coefficients updated for today's collimation data.
! 2007-12-12 DL Secondary coefficients updated after second set of data from above repair.
! 2007-12-12 SS Primary coefficients updated after optical collimation.
! 2007 12-24 SS Removed M1 tilts, put in new translatin values for better
! collimation.
! 2008-08-23 DL Secondary coefficients updated after shutdown.
! 2008-08-26 DL Secondary coefficients updated after transverse limit switch
!               replacement.
! 2015-07-29 DL Primary and secondary coefficients updated: mechanical collimation
! 2015-08-19 KP Primary coefficients  updated: optical collimation
! 2015-08-25 RO Cleaned up some outdated comments
! 2016-08-19 JD Primary and secondary coefficients updated:  mechanical collimation
! 2017-08-29 KP cleaned up some updating history comments and updated primary and secondary coefficients
!            with data from JohnD mechanical collimation. 
! 2018-08-30 CS Set RotLim from -180,360 to -101, 255
! 2019-08-15 JD Secondary coefficients updated.

! Mirror Control

! mirror collimation coefficients
! - piston and translation coefficients are in um
! - tilt coefficients are in arc-seconds
! - value = Coef1 + Coef2 sin(alt) + Coef3 cos(alt)

! Warning: the primary mirror sin and cos coefficients for tilt and translation must be zero,
! so that moving the telescope will not command a tilt or translation (which can induce a jump in tilt).

! piston scale coefficients based on the following from Jim Gunn May 6, 1999
! and corrected May 8 (he'd left a zero out of the scale factor):
! for a scale factor of 1.0001013 (magnifying the image)
! change in M1 piston is -1000 microns (motion is towards sky, hence negative)
! change in M2 piston is  -828 microns (motion is towards sky, hence negative)

! maximum scale factor; set <= 1 to disable scale adjustment
! note: minimum scale factor = 1/MaxScaleFac
MaxScaleFac       1.0008
! this limit allows slightly more travel than the primary and secondary
